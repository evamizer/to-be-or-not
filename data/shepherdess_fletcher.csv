"_Enter_ Clorin _a shepherdess, having buried her Love in an Arbour._",JF
"Hail, holy Earth, whose cold Arms do imbrace",JF
The truest man that ever fed his flocks,JF
"By the fat plains of fruitful _Thessaly_,",JF
"Thus I salute thy Grave, thus do I pay",JF
"My early vows, and tribute of mine eyes",JF
To thy still loved ashes; thus I free,JF
My self from all insuing heats and fires,JF
"Of love: all sports, delights and jolly games",JF
"That Shepherds hold full dear, thus put I off.",JF
Now no more shall these smooth brows be begirt,JF
"With youthful Coronals, and lead the Dance;",JF
No more the company of fresh fair Maids,JF
"And wanton Shepherds be to me delightful,",JF
Nor the shrill pleasing sound of merry pipes,JF
"Under some shady dell, when the cool wind",JF
"Plays on the leaves: all be far away,",JF
Since thou art far away; by whose dear side,JF
How often have I sat Crown'd with fresh flowers,JF
"For summers Queen, whil'st every Shepherds Boy",JF
"Puts on his lusty green, with gaudy hook,",JF
And hanging scrip of finest Cordevan.,JF
"But thou art gone, and these are gone with thee,",JF
And all are dead but thy dear memorie;,JF
"That shall out-live thee, and shall ever spring",JF
"Whilest there are pipes, or jolly Shepherds sing.",JF
"And here will I in honour of thy love,",JF
"Dwell by thy Grave, forgeting all those joys,",JF
"That former times made precious to mine eyes,",JF
Only remembring what my youth did gain,JF
"In the dark, hidden vertuous use of Herbs:",JF
"That will I practise, and as freely give",JF
"All my endeavours, as I gain'd them free.",JF
Of all green wounds I know the remedies,JF
"In Men or Cattel, be they stung with Snakes,",JF
"Or charm'd with powerful words of wicked Art,",JF
"Or be they Love-sick, or through too much heat",JF
"Grown wild or Lunatick, their eyes or ears",JF
"Thickned with misty filme of dulling Rheum,",JF
"These I can Cure, such secret vertue lies",JF
In Herbs applyed by a Virgins hand:,JF
"My meat shall be what these wild woods afford,",JF
"Berries, and Chesnuts, Plantanes, on whose Cheeks,",JF
"The Sun sits smiling, and the lofty fruit",JF
Pull'd from the fair head of the staight grown Pine;,JF
"On these I'le feed with free content and rest,",JF
"When night shall blind the world, by thy side blest.",JF
_Enter a_ Satyr.,JF
_Satyr._ Through yon same bending plain,JF
"That flings his arms down to the main,",JF
"And through these thick woods have I run,",JF
Whose bottom never kist the Sun,JF
"Since the lusty Spring began,",JF
"All to please my master _Pan,_",JF
Have I trotted without rest,JF
To get him Fruit; for at a Feast,JF
He entertains this coming night,JF
"His Paramour, the _Syrinx_ bright:",JF
But behold a fairer sight!                  [_He stands amazed._,JF
"By that Heavenly form of thine,",JF
"Brightest fair thou art divine,",JF
Sprung from great immortal race,JF
"Of the gods, for in thy face",JF
"Shines more awful Majesty,",JF
Than dull weak mortalitie,JF
"Dare with misty eyes behold,",JF
And live: therefore on this mold,JF
"Lowly do I bend my knee,",JF
In worship of thy Deitie;,JF
"Deign it Goddess from my hand,",JF
To receive what e're this land,JF
From her fertil Womb doth send,JF
Of her choice Fruits: and but lend,JF
"Belief to that the Satyre tells,",JF
"Fairer by the famous wells,",JF
"To this present day ne're grew,",JF
Never better nor more true.,JF
Here be Grapes whose lusty bloud,JF
"Is the learned Poets good,",JF
Sweeter yet did never crown,JF
"The head of _Bacchus_, Nuts more brown",JF
Than the Squirrels Teeth that crack them;,JF
Deign O fairest fair to take them.,JF
For these black ey'd _Driope_,JF
"Hath oftentimes commanded me,",JF
With my clasped knee to clime;,JF
See how well the lusty time,JF
"Hath deckt their rising cheeks in red,",JF
"Such as on your lips is spred,",JF
"Here be Berries for a Queen,",JF
"Some be red, some be green,",JF
"These are of that luscious meat,",JF
The great God _Pan_ himself doth eat:,JF
"All these, and what the woods can yield,",JF
"The hanging mountain or the field,",JF
"I freely offer, and ere long",JF
"Will bring you more, more sweet and strong,",JF
"Till when humbly leave I take,",JF
"Lest the great _Pan_ do awake,",JF
"That sleeping lies in a deep glade,",JF
"Under a broad Beeches shade,",JF
"I must go, I must run",JF
Swifter than the fiery Sun.                         [_Exit_.,JF
_Clo_. And all my fears go with thee.,JF
"What greatness or what private hidden power,",JF
Is there in me to draw submission,JF
"From this rude man, and beast? sure I am mortal:",JF
"The Daughter of a Shepherd, he was mortal:",JF
And she that bore me mortal: prick my hand,JF
"And it will bleed: a Feaver shakes me,",JF
"And the self same wind that makes the young Lambs shrink,",JF
Makes me a cold: my fear says I am mortal:,JF
Yet I have heard (my Mother told it me),JF
"And now I do believe it, if I keep",JF
"My Virgin Flower uncropt, pure, chaste, and fair,",JF
"No Goblin, Wood-god, Fairy, Elfe, or Fiend,",JF
"Satyr or other power that haunts the Groves,",JF
"Shall hurt my body, or by vain illusion",JF
Draw me to wander after idle fires;,JF
"Or voyces calling me in dead of night,",JF
"To make me follow, and so tole me on",JF
"Through mire and standing pools, to find my ruine:",JF
"Else why should this rough thing, who never knew",JF
"Manners, nor smooth humanity, whose heats",JF
"Are rougher than himself, and more mishapen,",JF
Thus mildly kneel to me? sure there is a power,JF
"In that great name of Virgin, that binds fast",JF
"All rude uncivil bloods, all appetites",JF
That break their confines: then strong Chastity,JF
"Be thou my strongest guard, for here I'le dwell",JF
In opposition against Fate and Hell.,JF
"_Enter an old_ Shepherd, _with him four couple of_ Shepherds",JF
_and_ Shepherdesses.,JF
_Old Shep_. Now we have done this holy Festival,JF
"In honour of our great God, and his rites",JF
"Perform'd, prepare your selves for chaste",JF
"And uncorrupted fires: that as the Priest,",JF
With powerful hand shall sprinkle on [your] Brows,JF
"His pure and holy water, ye may be",JF
"From all hot flames of lust, and loose thoughts free.",JF
"Kneel Shepherds, kneel, here comes the Priest of _Pan_.",JF
_Enter_ Priest.,JF
"_Priest_. Shepherds, thus I purge away,",JF
"Whatsoever this great day,",JF
"Or the past hours gave not good,",JF
To corrupt your Maiden blood:,JF
From the high rebellious heat,JF
"Of the Grapes, and strength of meat;",JF
"From the wanton quick desires,",JF
"They do kindle by their fires,",JF
"I do wash you with this water,",JF
Be you pure and fair hereafter.,JF
"From your Liver and your Veins,",JF
Thus I take away the stains.,JF
"All your thoughts be smooth and fair,",JF
Be ye fresh and free as Air.,JF
Never more let lustful heat,JF
"Through your purged conduits beat,",JF
"Or a plighted troth be broken,",JF
Or a wanton verse be spoken,JF
In a Shepherdesses ear;,JF
"Go your wayes, ye are all clear.",JF
[_They rise and sing in praise of_ Pan.,JF
The SONG.,JF
_Sing his praises that doth keep,JF

Whilest the hollow neighbouring ground,JF
Fills the Musick with her sound._,JF
"Pan, _O great God_ Pan, _to thee",JF
Thus do we sing:,JF
Thou that keep'st us chaste and free,JF
"As the young spring,",JF
"Ever be thy honour spoke,",JF
"From that place the morn is broke,",JF
To that place Day doth unyoke._,JF
[_Exeunt omnes but_ Perigot _and_ Amoret.,JF
"_Peri_. Stay gentle _Amoret_, thou fair brow'd Maid,",JF
"Thy Shepherd prays thee stay, that holds thee dear,",JF
Equal with his souls good.,JF
_Amo_. Speak; I give,JF
"Thee freedom Shepherd, and thy tongue be still",JF
"The same it ever was; as free from ill,",JF
As he whose conversation never knew,JF
The Court or City be thou ever true.,JF
"_Peri_. When I fall off from my affection,",JF
"Or mingle my clean thoughts with foul desires,",JF
"First let our great God cease to keep my flocks,",JF
"That being left alone without a guard,",JF
"The Wolf, or Winters rage, Summers great heat,",JF
"And want of Water, Rots; or what to us",JF
"Of ill is yet unknown, full speedily,",JF
And in their general ruine let me feel.,JF
"_Amo_. I pray thee gentle Shepherd wish not so,",JF
I do believe thee: 'tis as hard for me,JF
"To think thee false, and harder than for thee",JF
To hold me foul.,JF
_Peri_. O you are fairer far,JF
"Than the chaste blushing morn, or that fair star",JF
"That guides the wandring Sea-men through the deep,",JF
Straighter than straightest Pine upon the steep,JF
"Head of an aged mountain, and more white",JF
Than the new Milk we strip before day-light,JF
From the full fraighted bags of our fair flocks:,JF
Your hair more beauteous than those hanging locks,JF
Of young _Apollo_.,JF
"_Amo_. Shepherd be not lost,",JF
Y'are sail'd too far already from the Coast,JF
Of our discourse.,JF
_Peri_. Did you not tell me once,JF
"I should not love alone, I should not lose",JF
"Those many passions, vows, and holy Oaths,",JF
"I've sent to Heaven? did you not give your hand,",JF
Even that fair hand in hostage? Do not then,JF
"Give back again those sweets to other men,",JF
You your self vow'd were mine.,JF
"_Amo_. Shepherd, so far as Maidens modesty",JF
"May give assurance, I am once more thine,",JF
Once more I give my hand; be ever free,JF
"From that great foe to faith, foul jealousie.",JF
"_Peri_. I take it as my best good, and desire",JF
"For stronger confirmation of our love,",JF
"To meet this happy night in that fair Grove,",JF
Where all true Shepherds have rewarded been,JF
"For their long service: say sweet, shall it hold?",JF
"_Amo_. Dear friend, you must not blame me if I make",JF
"A doubt of what the silent night may do,",JF
Coupled with this dayes heat to move your bloud:,JF
Maids must be fearful; sure you have not been,JF
Wash'd white enough; for yet I see a stain,JF
"Stick in your Liver, go and purge again.",JF
"_Peri_. O do not wrong my honest simple truth,",JF
My self and my affections are as pure,JF
As those chaste flames that burn before the shrine,JF
Of the great _Dian_: only my intent,JF
"To draw you thither, was to plight our troths,",JF
"With enterchange of mutual chaste embraces,",JF
And ceremonious tying of our selves:,JF
For to that holy wood is consecrate,JF
"A vertuous well, about whose flowry banks,",JF
"The nimble-footed Fairies dance their rounds,",JF
"By the pale moon-shine, dipping oftentimes",JF
"Their stolen Children, so to make them free",JF
"From dying flesh, and dull mortalitie;",JF
"By this fair Fount hath many a Shepherd sworn,",JF
"And given away his freedom, many a troth",JF
"Been plight, which neither envy, nor old time",JF
"Could ever break, with many a chaste kiss given,",JF
In hope of coming happiness; by this,JF
Fresh Fountain many a blushing Maid,JF
Hath crown'd the head of her long loved Shepherd,JF
"With gaudy flowers, whilest he happy sung",JF
Layes of his love and dear Captivitie;,JF
There grows all Herbs fit to cool looser flames,JF
"Our sensual parts provoke, chiding our bloods,",JF
And quenching by their power those hidden sparks,JF
"That else would break out, and provoke our sense",JF
"To open fires, so vertuous is that place:",JF
"Then gentle Shepherdess, believe and grant,",JF
In troth it fits not with that face to scant,JF
Your faithful Shepherd of those chaste desires,JF
"He ever aim'd at, and--",JF
"_Amo_. Thou hast prevail'd, farewel, this coming night",JF
Shall crown thy chast hopes with long wish'd delight.,JF
_Peri_. Our great god _Pan_ reward thee for that good,JF
Thou hast given thy poor Shepherd: fairest Bud,JF
"Of Maiden Vertues, when I leave to be",JF
"The true Admirer of thy Chastitie,",JF
Let me deserve the hot polluted Name,JF
"Of the wild Woodman, or affect: some Dame,",JF
Whose often Prostitution hath begot,JF
"More foul Diseases, than ever yet the hot",JF
"Sun bred through his burnings, whilst the Dog",JF
"Pursues the raging Lion, throwing Fog,",JF
"And deadly Vapour from his angry Breath,",JF
Filling the lower World with Plague and Death.     [_Ex._ Am.,JF
_Enter_ Amaryllis.,JF
"_Ama_. Shepherd, may I desire to be believ'd,",JF
What I shall blushing tell?,JF
"_Peri_. Fair Maid, you may.",JF
"_Am_. Then softly thus, I love thee, _Perigot_,",JF
"And would be gladder to be lov'd again,",JF
Than the cold Earth is in his frozen arms,JF
"To clip the wanton Spring: nay do not start,",JF
"Nor wonder that I woo thee, thou that art",JF
"The prime of our young Grooms, even the top",JF
Of all our lusty Shepherds! what dull eye,JF
"That never was acquainted with desire,",JF
"Hath seen thee wrastle, run, or cast the Stone",JF
"With nimble strength and fair delivery,",JF
"And hath not sparkled fire, and speedily",JF
Sent secret heat to all the neighbouring Veins?,JF
"Who ever heard thee sing, that brought again",JF
"That freedom back, was lent unto thy Voice;",JF
Then do not blame me (Shepherd) if I be,JF
"One to be numbred in this Companie,",JF
"Since none that ever saw thee yet, were free.",JF
"_Peri_. Fair Shepherdess, much pity I can lend",JF
To your Complaints: but sure I shall not love:,JF
"All that is mine, my self, and my best hopes",JF
Are given already; do not love him then,JF
That cannot love again: on other men,JF
"Bestow those heats more free, that may return",JF
"You fire for fire, and in one flame equal burn.",JF
_Ama_. Shall I rewarded be so slenderly,JF
"For my affection, most unkind of men!",JF
"If I were old, or had agreed with Art",JF
"To give another Nature to my Cheeks,",JF
Or were I common Mistress to the love,JF
"Of every Swain, or could I with such ease",JF
"Call back my Love, as many a Wanton doth;",JF
"Thou might'st refuse me, Shepherd; but to thee",JF
"I am only fixt and set, let it not be",JF
"A Sport, thou gentle Shepherd to abuse",JF
The love of silly Maid.,JF
"_Peri_. Fair Soul, ye use",JF
"These words to little end: for know, I may",JF
"Better call back that time was Yesterday,",JF
"Or stay the coming Night, than bring my Love",JF
"Home to my self again, or recreant prove.",JF
"I will no longer hold you with delays,",JF
This present night I have appointed been,JF
To meet that chaste Fair (that enjoys my Soul),JF
"In yonder Grove, there to make up our Loves.",JF
"Be not deceiv'd no longer, chuse again,",JF
"These neighbouring Plains have many a comely Swain,",JF
"Fresher, and freer far than I e'r was,",JF
"Bestow that love on them, and let me pass.",JF
"Farewel, be happy in a better Choice.               [_Exit_.",JF
"_Ama_. Cruel, thou hast struck me deader with thy Voice",JF
Than if the angry Heavens with their quick flames,JF
"Had shot me through: I must not leave to love,",JF
"I cannot, no I must enjoy thee, Boy,",JF
Though the great dangers 'twixt my hopes and that,JF
Be infinite: there is a Shepherd dwells,JF
"Down by the Moor, whose life hath ever shown",JF
"More sullen Discontent than _Saturns_ Brow,",JF
When he sits frowning on the Births of Men:,JF
One that doth wear himself away in loneness;,JF
And never joys unless it be in breaking,JF
The holy plighted troths of mutual Souls:,JF
"One that lusts after [every] several Beauty,",JF
"But never yet was known to love or like,",JF
"Were the face fairer, or more full of truth,",JF
"Than _Phoebe_ in her fulness, or the youth",JF
Of smooth _Lyaeus_; whose nigh starved flocks,JF
"Are always scabby, and infect all Sheep",JF
"They feed withal; whose Lambs are ever last,",JF
"And dye before their waining, and whose Dog",JF
"Looks like his Master, lean, and full of scurf,",JF
Not caring for the Pipe or Whistle: this man may,JF
"(If he be well wrought) do a deed of wonder,",JF
Forcing me passage to my long desires:,JF
"And here he comes, as fitly to my purpose,",JF
As my quick thoughts could wish for.,JF
_Enter_ Shepherd.,JF
"_Shep_. Fresh Beauty, let me not be thought uncivil,",JF
Thus to be Partner of your loneness: 'twas,JF
My Love (that ever working passion) drew,JF
Me to this place to seek some remedy,JF
"For my sick Soul: be not unkind and fair,",JF
For such the mighty Cupid in his doom,JF
Hath sworn to be aveng'd on; then give room,JF
"To my consuming Fires, that so I may",JF
"Enjoy my long Desires, and so allay",JF
Those flames that else would burn my life away.,JF
"_Ama_. Shepherd, were I but sure thy heart were sound",JF
"As thy words seem to be, means might be found",JF
To cure thee of thy long pains; for to me,JF
That heavy youth-consuming Miserie,JF
"The love-sick Soul endures, never was pleasing;",JF
I could be well content with the quick easing,JF
"Of thee, and thy hot fires, might it procure",JF
Thy faith and farther service to be sure.,JF
"_Shep_. Name but that great work, danger, or what can",JF
"Be compass'd by the Wit or Art of Man,",JF
"And if I fail in my performance, may",JF
I never more kneel to the rising Day.,JF
"_Ama_. Then thus I try thee, Shepherd, this same night,",JF
"That now comes stealing on, a gentle pair",JF
"Have promis'd equal Love, and do appoint",JF
To make yon Wood the place where hands and hearts,JF
Are to be ty'd for ever: break their meeting,JF
"And their strong Faith, and I am ever thine.",JF
"_Shep_. Tell me their Names, and if I do not move",JF
(By my great power) the Centre of their Love,JF
"From his fixt being, let me never more",JF
Warm me by those fair Eyes I thus adore.,JF
"_Ama_. Come, as we go, I'll tell thee what they are,",JF
And give thee fit directions for thy work.           [_Exeunt._,JF
_Enter_ Cloe.,JF
"_Cloe_. How have I wrong'd the times, or men, that thus",JF
After this holy Feast I pass unknown,JF
And unsaluted? 'twas not wont to be,JF
Thus frozen with the younger companie,JF
"Of jolly Shepherds; 'twas not then held good,",JF
For lusty Grooms to mix their quicker blood,JF
"With that dull humour, most unfit to be",JF
"The friend of man, cold and dull Chastitie.",JF
"Sure I am held not fair, or am too old,",JF
"Or else not free enough, or from my fold",JF
"Drive not a flock sufficient great, to gain",JF
The greedy eyes of wealth-alluring Swain:,JF
"Yet if I may believe what others say,",JF
My face has soil enough; nor can they lay,JF
Justly too strict a Coyness to my Charge;,JF
"My Flocks are many, and the Downs as large",JF
They feed upon: then let it ever be,JF
"Their Coldness, not my Virgin Modestie",JF
Makes me complain.,JF
_Enter_ Thenot.,JF
_The_. Was ever Man but I,JF
Thus truly taken with uncertainty?,JF
Where shall that Man be found that loves a mind,JF
"Made up in Constancy, and dare not find",JF
His Love rewarded? here let all men know,JF
A Wretch that lives to love his Mistress so.,JF
"_Clo_. Shepherd, I pray thee stay, where hast thou been?",JF
Or whither go'st thou? here be Woods as green,JF
"As any, air likewise as fresh and sweet,",JF
As where smooth _Zephyrus_ plays on the fleet,JF
"Face of the curled Streams, with Flowers as many",JF
"As the young Spring gives, and as choise as any;",JF
"Here be all new Delights, cool Streams and Wells,",JF
"Arbors o'rgrown with Woodbinds, Caves, and Dells,",JF
"Chase where thou wilt, whilst I sit by, and sing,",JF
Or gather Rushes to make many a Ring,JF
"For thy long fingers; tell thee tales of Love,",JF
"How the pale _Phoebe_ hunting in a Grove,",JF
"First saw the Boy _Endymion_, from whose Eyes",JF
She took eternal fire that never dyes;,JF
"How she convey'd him softly in a sleep,",JF
His temples bound with poppy to the steep,JF
"Head of old _Latmus_, where she stoops each night,",JF
"Gilding the Mountain with her Brothers light,",JF
To kiss her sweetest.,JF
_The_. Far from me are these,JF
"Hot flashes, bred from wanton heat and ease;",JF
I have forgot what love and loving meant:,JF
"Rhimes, Songs, and merry Rounds, that oft are sent",JF
"To the soft Ears of Maids, are strange to me;",JF
"Only I live t' admire a Chastitie,",JF
"That neither pleasing Age, smooth tongue, or Gold,",JF
"Could ever break upon, so pure a Mold",JF
Is that her Mind was cast in; 'tis to her,JF
I only am reserv'd; she is my form I stir,JF
"By, breath and move, 'tis she and only she",JF
"Can make me happy, or give miserie.",JF
"_Clo_. Good Shepherd, may a Stranger crave to know",JF
To whom this dear observance you do ow?,JF
"_The_. You may, and by her Vertue learn to square",JF
And level out your Life; for to be fair,JF
"And nothing vertuous, only fits the Eye",JF
"Of gaudy Youth, and swelling Vanitie.",JF
"Then know, she's call'd the Virgin of the Grove,",JF
"She that hath long since bury'd her chaste Love,",JF
"And now lives by his Grave, for whose dear Soul",JF
She hath vow'd her self into the holy Roll,JF
"Of strict Virginity; 'tis her I so admire,",JF
"Not any looser Blood, or new desire.",JF
"_Clo_. Farewel poor Swain, thou art not for my bend,",JF

Hath been content to live: here boldly take,JF

Was given away to any: and but sit,JF
"Down on this rushy Bank, whilst I go pull",JF
"Fresh Blossoms from the Boughs, or quickly cull",JF
"The choicest delicates from yonder Mead,",JF
"To make thee Chains, or Chaplets, or to spread",JF
"Under our fainting Bodies, when delight",JF
Shall lock up all our senses. How the sight,JF
Of those smooth rising Cheeks renew the story,JF
"Of young _Adonis_, when in Pride and Glory",JF
He lay infolded 'twixt the beating arms,JF
Of willing _Venus_: methinks stronger Charms,JF
"Dwell in those speaking eyes, and on that brow",JF
More sweetness than the Painters can allow,JF
"To their best pieces: not _Narcissus_, he",JF
That wept himself away in memorie,JF
"Of his own Beauty, nor _Silvanus_ Boy,",JF
"Nor the twice ravish'd Maid, for whom old _Troy_",JF

Be like a rock made firmly up 'gainst all,JF

"Or else to him I'le slander _Amoret_,",JF
"And say, she but seems chaste; I'le swear she met",JF
Me 'mongst the shady Sycamores last night,JF

"Of leaves and many flowers, where she spread",JF
Her willing body to be prest by me;,JF
"There have I carv'd her name on many a tree,",JF

To shoot at nimble Squirrels in the holt;,JF
"A pair of painted Buskins, and a Lamb,",JF
"Soft as his own locks, or the down of swan;",JF

Me double pleasure. Discord makes me live.,JF

"Even once to stir, much more to overthrow",JF
"His fixed love from judgement, who doth know",JF
"Your nature, my end, and his chosens merit;",JF

Illusion? Sure such fancies oft have been,JF
"Sent to abuse true love, and yet are seen,",JF
Daring to blind the vertuous thought with errour.,JF

Deserved favours that deny to take,JF

Thus backward? What a world of precious Art,JF

"_Hecate_ with shapes three,",JF

"With this holy water wet,",JF
To the shape of _Amoret_:,JF
"_Cynthia_ work thou with my charm,",JF
Thus I draw thee free from harm,JF
"Up out of this blessed Lake,",JF
Rise both like her and awake.                   [_She awakes_.,JF
"_Amar_. Speak Shepherd, am I _Amoret_ to sight?",JF
Or hast thou mist in any Magick rite;,JF
"For want of which any defect in me,",JF
May make our practices discovered be.,JF
"_Sul_. By yonder Moon, but that I here do stand,",JF
"Whose breath hath thus transform'd thee, and whose hand",JF
"Let thee down dry, and pluckt thee up thus wet,",JF
I should my self take thee for _Amoret_;,JF
"Thou art in cloths, in feature, voice and hew",JF
"So like, that sense cannot distinguish you.",JF
"_Amar_. Then this deceit which cannot crossed be,",JF
"At once shall lose her him, and gain thee me.",JF
"Hither she needs must come by promise made,",JF
"And sure his nature never was so bad,",JF
"To bid a Virgin meet him in the wood,",JF
"When night and fear are up, but understood,",JF
"Twas his part to come first: being come, I'le say,",JF
"My constant love made me come first and stay,",JF
"Then will I lead him further to the grove,",JF
"But stay you here, and if his own true love",JF
"Shall seek him here, set her in some wrong path,",JF
"Which say, her lover lately troden hath;",JF
"I'le not be far from hence, if need there be,",JF
"Here is another charm, whose power will free",JF
"The dazeled sense, read by the Moons beams clear,",JF
And in my own true map make me appear.,JF
_Enter_ Perigot.,JF
"_Sull_. Stand close, here's _Perigot_, whose constant heart",JF
Longs to behold her in whose shape thou art.,JF
_Per_. This is the place (fair _Amoret_) the hour,JF
Is yet scarce come: Here every Sylvan power,JF
"Delights to be about yon sacred Well,",JF
Which they have blest with many a powerful Spell;,JF
"For never Traveller in dead of Night,",JF
"Nor strayed Beasts have faln in, but when sight",JF
"Hath fail'd them, then their right way they have found",JF
"By help of them, so holy is the ground:",JF
"But I will farther seek, lest _Amoret_",JF
"Should be first come, and so stray long unmet.",JF
"My _Amoret, Amoret_.          [_Ex_. Amaryllis, Perigot.",JF
_Per_. My Love.,JF
_Amar_. I come my Love.                       [_Exit_.,JF
_Sull_. Now she has got,JF

Of my long lookt for hopes as well as she.,JF
"How bright the moon shines here, as if she strove",JF
"To show her Glory in this little Grove,",JF
_Enter_ Amoret.,JF
To some new loved Shepherd. Yonder is,JF
Another _Amoret_. Where differs this,JF
"From that? but that she _Perigot_ hath met,",JF
I should have ta'n this for the counterfeit:,JF
"Herbs, Woods, and Springs, the power that in you lies,",JF
If mortal men could know your Properties!,JF
"_Amo_. Methinks it is not Night, I have no fear,",JF
"Walking this Wood, of Lions, or the Bear,",JF
"Whose Names at other times have made me quake,",JF
When any Shepherdess in her tale spake,JF
"Of some of them, that underneath a Wood",JF
Have torn true Lovers that together stood.,JF
"Methinks there are no Goblins, and mens talk,",JF
"That in these Woods the nimble Fairies walk,",JF
"Are fables; such a strong heart I have got,",JF
Because I come to meet with _Perigot_.,JF
"My _Perigot_! who's that, my _Perigot_?",JF
_Sull_. Fair maid.,JF
"_Amo_. Ay me, thou art not _Perigot_.",JF
_Sull_. But I can tell ye news of _Perigot_:,JF
An hour together under yonder tree,JF
"He sate with wreathed arms and call'd on thee,",JF
"And said, why _Amoret_ stayest thou so long?",JF
"Then starting up, down yonder path he flung,",JF
"Lest thou hadst miss'd thy way: were it day light,",JF
He could not yet have born him out of sight.,JF
"_Amor_. Thanks, gentle Shepherd, and beshrew my stay,",JF
That made me fearful I had lost my way:,JF
As fast as my weak Legs (that cannot be,JF
"Weary with seeking him) will carry me,",JF
I'll seek him out; and for thy Courtesie,JF
Pray _Pan_ thy Love may ever follow thee.        [_Exit_.,JF
"_Sull_. How bright she was, how lovely did she show!",JF
Was it not pity to deceive her so?,JF
"She pluckt her Garments up, and tript away,",JF
And with her Virgin-innocence did pray,JF
"For me that perjur'd her. Whilst she was here,",JF
Methought the Beams of Light that did appear,JF
"Were shot from her; methought the Moon gave none,",JF
But what it had from her: she was alone,JF
"With me, if then her presence did so move,",JF
Why did not I essay to win her Love?,JF
She would not sure have yielded unto me;,JF
"Women love only Opportunitie,",JF
"And not the Man; or if she had deny'd,",JF
"Alone, I might have forc'd her to have try'd",JF
"Who had been stronger: O vain Fool, to let",JF
"Such blest Occasion pass; I'll follow yet,",JF

I come sweet _Amoret_: Soft who is here?,JF
A pair of Lovers? He shall yield her me;,JF

"_Cloe_, I know ere this would weary be.",JF
"_Clo_. _Alexis_, let us rest here, if the place",JF
"Be private, and out of the common trace",JF
Of every Shepherd: for I understood,JF
This Night a number are about the Wood:,JF
"Then let us chuse some place, where out of sight",JF
We freely may enjoy our stoln delight.,JF
"_Alex_. Then boldly here, where we shall ne're be found,",JF
"No Shepherds way lies here, 'tis hallow'd ground:",JF
"No Maid seeks here her strayed Cow, or Sheep,",JF
"Fairies, and Fawns, and Satyrs do it keep:",JF
"Then carelesly rest here, and clip and kiss,",JF
And let no fear make us our pleasures miss.,JF
"_Clo_. Then lye by me, the sooner we begin,",JF
The longer ere the day descry our sin.,JF
"_Sull_. Forbear to touch my Love, or by yon flame,",JF
"The greatest power that Shepherds dare to name,",JF
Here where thou sit'st under this holy tree,JF
"Her to dishonour, thou shalt buried be.",JF
"_Alex_. If _Pan_ himself, should come out of the lawns,",JF
"With all his Troops of Satyrs and of Fawns,",JF
"And bid me leave, I swear by her two eyes,",JF
"A greater Oath than thine, I would not rise.",JF
"_Sull_. Then from the cold Earth never shalt thou move,",JF
But lose at one stroke both thy Life and Love.,JF
_Clo_. Hold gentle Shepherd.,JF
"_Sull_. Fairest Shepherdess,",JF
"Come you with me, I do not love you less",JF
"Than that fond man, that would have kept you there",JF
From me of more desert.,JF
_Alex_. O yet forbear,JF
To take her from me; give me leave to dye,JF
By her.,JF

"_Sat_. Now whilst the Moon doth rule the Skie,",JF
"And the Stars, whose feeble light",JF
"Give a pale Shadow to the night,",JF

"To walk this Grove about, whilst he",JF
"In a corner of the Wood,",JF
"Where never mortal foot hath stood,",JF
"Keeps dancing, musick, and a feast",JF
"To entertain a lovely Guest,",JF
"Where he gives her many a Rose,",JF
Sweeter than the breath that blows,JF
"The leaves; Grapes, Berries of the best,",JF
I never saw so great a feast.,JF
"But to my Charge: here must I stay,",JF
"To see what mortals lose their way,",JF
"And by a false fire seeming bright,",JF
Train them in and leave them right.,JF
Then must I watch if any be,JF
Forcing of a Chastitie:,JF
"If I find it, then in haste",JF
"Give my wreathed horn a Blast,",JF
"And the Fairies all will run,",JF
"Wildly dancing by the Moon,",JF
"And will pinch him to the bone,",JF
Till his lustful thoughts be gone.,JF
_Alex_. O Death!,JF
"_Sat_. Back again about this ground,",JF
Sure I hear a mortal sound;,JF
"I bind thee by this powerful Spell,",JF
"By the Waters of this Well,",JF
"By the glimmering Moon beams bright,",JF
"Speak again, thou mortal wight.",JF
_Alex_. Oh!,JF
"_Sat_. Here the foolish mortal lies,",JF
Sleeping on the ground: arise.,JF
"The poor wight is almost dead,",JF
"On the ground his wounds have bled,",JF
And his cloaths foul'd with his blood:,JF
To my Goddess in the Wood,JF
"Will I lead him, whose hands pure,",JF
Will help this mortal wight to cure.,JF
_Enter_ Cloe _again_.,JF
"_Clo_. Since I beheld yon shaggy man, my Breast",JF
"Doth pant, each bush, methinks, should hide a Beast:",JF
"Yet my desire keeps still above my fear,",JF
"I would fain meet some Shepherd, knew I where:",JF
"For from one cause of fear I am most free,",JF
"It is impossible to ravish me,",JF
I am so willing.  Here upon this ground,JF
I left my Love all bloody with his wound;,JF
"Yet till that fearful shape made me be gone,",JF
"Though he were hurt, I furnisht was of one,",JF
"But now both lost. _Alexis_, speak or move,",JF
"If thou hast any life, thou art yet my Love.",JF
"He's dead, or else is with his little might",JF
Crept from the Bank for fear of that ill Spright.,JF
"Then where art thou that struck'st my love? O stay,",JF
"Bring me thy self in change, and then I'll say",JF
"Thou hast some justice, I will make thee trim",JF
With Flowers and Garlands that were meant for him;,JF
"I'll clip thee round with both mine arms, as fast",JF
As I did mean he should have been embrac'd:,JF
But thou art fled. What hope is left for me?,JF
"I'll run to _Daphnis_ in the hollow tree,",JF
"Whom I did mean to mock, though hope be small,",JF
"To make him bold; rather than none at all,",JF
"I'll try him; his heart, and my behaviour too",JF
Perhaps may teach him what he ought to do.           [_Exit_.,JF
_Enter_ Sullen Shepherd.,JF
"_Sul_. This was the place, 'twas but my feeble sight,",JF
"Mixt with the horrour of my deed, and night,",JF
"That shap't these fears, and made me run away,",JF
And lose my beauteous hardly gotten prey.,JF
"Speak gentle Shepherdess, I am alone,",JF
And tender love for love: but she is gone,JF
"From me, that having struck her Lover dead,",JF
For silly fear left her alone and fled.,JF
And see the wounded body is remov'd,JF
By her of whom it was so well belov'd.,JF
_Enter_ Perigot _and_ Amaryllis _in the shape of_ Amoret.,JF
"But these fancies must be quite forgot,",JF
I must lye close. Here comes young _Perigot_,JF
With subtile _Amaryllis_ in the shape,JF
Of _Amoret_. Pray Love he may not 'scape.,JF
"_Amar_. Beloved _Perigot_, shew me some place,",JF
"Where I may rest my limbs, weak with the Chace",JF
"Of thee, an hour before thou cam'st at least.",JF
_Per_. Beshrew my tardy steps: here shalt thou rest,JF
"Upon this holy bank, no deadly Snake",JF
Upon this turf her self in folds doth make.,JF
Here is no poyson for the Toad to feed;,JF
"Here boldly spread thy hands, no venom'd Weed",JF
"Dares blister them, no slimy Snail dare creep",JF
Over thy face when thou art fast asleep;,JF
"Here never durst the babling Cuckow spit,",JF
No slough of falling Star did ever hit,JF
"Upon this bank: let this thy Cabin be,",JF
This other set with Violets for me.,JF
_Ama_. Thou dost not love me _Perigot_.,JF
"_Per_. Fair maid,",JF
You only love to hear it often said;,JF
You do not doubt.,JF
_Amar_. Believe me but I do.,JF
_Per_. What shall we now begin again to woo?,JF
"Tis the best way to make your Lover last,",JF
"To play with him, when you have caught him fast.",JF
"_Amar_. By _Pan_ I swear, I loved _Perigot_,",JF
"And by yon Moon, I think thou lov'st me not.",JF
"_Per_. By _Pan_ I swear, and if I falsely swear,",JF
"Let him not guard my flocks, let Foxes tear",JF
"My earliest Lambs, and Wolves whilst I do sleep",JF
"Fall on the rest, a Rot among my Sheep.",JF
I love thee better than the careful Ewe,JF
The new-yean'd Lamb that is of her own hew;,JF
I dote upon thee more than the young Lamb,JF
Doth on the bag that feeds him from his Dam.,JF
"Were there a sort of Wolves got in my Fold,",JF
"And one ran after thee, both young and old",JF
"Should be devour'd, and it should be my strife",JF
"To save thee, whom I love above my life.",JF
_Ama_. How shall I trust thee when I see thee chuse,JF
"Another Bed, and dost my side refuse?",JF
_Per_. 'Twas only that the chast thoughts might be shewn,JF
"Twixt thee and me, although we were alone.",JF
"_Ama_. Come, _Perigot_ will shew his power, that he",JF
"Can make his _Amoret_, though she weary be,",JF
"Rise nimbly from her Couch, and come to his.",JF
"Here take thy _Amoret_, embrace and kiss.",JF
_Per_. What means my Love?,JF
"_Ama_. To do as lovers shou'd,",JF
"That are to be enjoy'd, not to be woo'd.",JF
There's ne'r a Shepherdess in all the plain,JF
"Can kiss thee with more Art, there's none can feign",JF
More wanton tricks.,JF
"_Per_. Forbear, dear Soul, to trie",JF
Whether my Heart be pure; I'll rather die,JF
Than nourish one thought to dishonour thee.,JF
_Amar_. Still think'st thou such a thing as Chastitie,JF
"Is amongst Women? _Perigot_ there's none,",JF
"That with her Love is in a Wood alone,",JF
And would come home a maid; be not abus'd,JF
"With thy fond first Belief, let time be us'd:",JF
Why dost thou rise?,JF
_Per_. My true heart thou hast slain.,JF
"_Ama_. Faith _Perigot_, I'll pluck thee down again.",JF
"_Per_. Let go, thou Serpent, that into my brest",JF
Hast with thy cunning div'd; art not in Jest?,JF
"_Ama_. Sweet love, lye down.",JF
"_Per_. Since this I live to see,",JF
Some bitter North-wind blast my flocks and me.,JF
"_Ama_. You swore you lov'd, yet will not do my will.",JF
"_Per_. O be as thou wert once, I'll love thee still.",JF
"_Ama_. I am, as still I was, and all my kind,",JF
Though other shows we have poor men to blind.,JF

All mists that dazel sence.,JF
Herbs and Springs whose hidden might,JF
"Alters Shapes, and mocks the sight,",JF
Thus I charge you to undo,JF
All before I brought ye to:,JF

"_Amar._ Forbear thou gentle Swain, thou dost mistake,",JF
"She whom thou follow'dst fled into the brake,",JF
"And as I crost thy way, I met thy wrath,",JF
The only fear of which near slain me hath.,JF
"_Per._ Pardon fair Shepherdess, my rage and night",JF
"Were both upon me, and beguil'd my sight;",JF
But far be it from me to spill the blood,JF
Of harmless Maids that wander in the Wood.         [_Ex._ Ama.,JF

Men never knew that vertue Constancie.,JF

"Extream fire for an hour, and presently",JF
"Colder than sleepy poyson, or the Sea,",JF
Upon whose face sits a continual frost:,JF

"Or tongues of men, guilty so great a crime",JF
"As wronging simple Maid? O _Perigot_,",JF
"Thou that wast yesterday without a blot,",JF
"Thou that wast every good, and every thing",JF
That men call blessed; thou that wast the spring,JF
From whence our looser grooms drew all their best;,JF
"Thou that wast alwayes just, and alwayes blest",JF
In faith and promise; thou that hadst the name,JF
"Of Vertuous given thee, and made good the same",JF
Ev'en from thy Cradle; thou that wast that all,JF
That men delighted in; Oh what a fall,JF
"Is this, to have been so, and now to be",JF
"The only best in wrong and infamie,",JF
And I to live to know this! and by me,JF

"Another, and far dearer than the last;",JF
"Dearer than thou canst love thy self, though all",JF
The self love were within thee that did fall,JF
"With that coy Swain that now is made a flower,",JF
"For whose dear sake, Echo weeps many a shower.",JF
And am I thus rewarded for my flame?,JF
Lov'd worthily to get a wantons name?,JF
"Come thou forsaken Willow, wind my head,",JF
And noise it to the world my Love is dead:,JF
"I am forsaken, I am cast away.",JF
"And left for every lazy Groom to say,",JF
"I was unconstant, light, and sooner lost",JF
"Than the quick Clouds we see, or the chill Frost",JF
"When the hot Sun beats on it. Tell me yet,",JF
Canst thou not love again thy _Amoret_?,JF
"_Per_. Thou art not worthy of that blessed name,",JF
"I must not know thee, fling thy wanton flame",JF
"Upon some lighter blood, that may be hot",JF
With words and feigned passions: _Perigot_,JF
"Was ever yet unstain'd, and shall not now",JF
Stoop to the meltings of a borrowed brow.,JF
"_Amo_. Then hear me heaven, to whom I call for right,",JF
And you fair twinkling stars that crown the night;,JF
"And hear me woods, and silence of this place,",JF
And ye sad hours that move a sullen pace;,JF
Hear me ye shadows that delight to dwell,JF
"In horrid darkness, and ye powers of Hell,",JF
"Whilst I breath out my last; I am that maid,",JF
"That yet untainted _Amoret_, that plaid",JF
"The careless prodigal, and gave away",JF
"My soul to this young man, that now dares say",JF
"I am a stranger, not the same, more wild;",JF
And thus with much belief I was beguil'd.,JF
"I am that maid, that have delaid, deny'd,",JF
And almost scorn'd the loves of all that try'd,JF
"To win me, but this swain, and yet confess",JF
I have been woo'd by many with no less,JF
"Soul of affection, and have often had",JF
"Rings, Belts, and Cracknels sent me from the lad",JF
That feeds his flocks down westward; Lambs and Doves,JF
"By young _Alexis; Daphnis_ sent me gloves,",JF
"All which I gave to thee: nor these, nor they",JF
"That sent them did I smile on, or e're lay",JF
Up to my after-memory. But why,JF
"Do I resolve to grieve, and not to dye?",JF
"Happy had been the stroke thou gav'st, if home;",JF
By this time had I found a quiet room,JF
"Where every slave is free, and every brest",JF
"That living breeds new care, now lies at rest,",JF
And thither will poor _Amoret_.,JF
_Per_. Thou must.,JF
Was ever any man so loth to trust,JF
His eyes as I? or was there ever yet,JF
Any so like as this to _Amoret_?,JF
"For whose dear sake, I promise if there be",JF
"A living soul within thee, thus to free",JF
Thy body from it.                     [_He hurts her again_.,JF

"_Satyr_. See the day begins to break,",JF
And the light shoots like a streak,JF
"Of subtil fire, the wind blows cold,",JF
Whilst the morning doth unfold;,JF
"Now the Birds begin to rouse,",JF
And the Squirril from the boughs,JF
Leaps to get him Nuts and fruit;,JF
"The early Lark that erst was mute,",JF
Carrols to the rising day,JF
Many a note and many a lay:,JF
"Therefore here I end my watch,",JF

_Satyr_. Yet more blood!,JF
Sure these wanton Swains are wode.,JF
Can there be a hand or heart,JF
Dare commit so vile a part,JF
As this Murther? By the Moon,JF
"That hid her self when this was done,",JF
Never was a sweeter face:,JF
I will bear her to the place,JF
Where my Goddess keeps; and crave,JF

He hath espy'd some thing that glisters nigh,JF
"Which he would have, yet give it him, away",JF
"He throws it straight, and cryes afresh to play",JF
"With something else: such my affection, set",JF

"_Clor_. No let me die, but by thy side remain.",JF
_The_. There's none shall know that thou didst ever stain,JF
"Thy worthy strictness, but shall honour'd be,",JF
"And I will lye again under this tree,",JF
"And pine and dye for thee with more delight,",JF
Than I have sorrow now to know the light.,JF
"_Clor_. Let me have thee, and I'le be where thou wilt.",JF
"_The_. Thou art of womens race, and full of guilt.",JF
"Farewel all hope of that Sex, whilst I thought",JF
"There was one good, I fear'd to find one naught:",JF
"But since their minds I all alike espie,",JF
"Henceforth I'le choose as others, by mine eye.",JF
"_Clor_. Blest be ye powers that give such quick redress,",JF
And for my labours sent so good success.,JF
"I rather choose, though I a woman be,",JF
"He should speak ill of all, than die for me.",JF
_Actus Quintus. Scena Prima_.,JF
"_Enter_ Priest, _and old_ Shepherd.",JF
"_Priest_. Shepherds, rise and shake off sleep,",JF
See the blushing Morn doth peep,JF
"Through the window, whilst the Sun",JF
"To the mountain tops is run,",JF
Gilding all the Vales below,JF
"With his rising flames, which grow",JF
Greater by his climbing still.,JF
"Up ye lazie grooms, and fill",JF
Bagg and Bottle for the field;,JF
"Clasp your cloaks fast, lest they yield",JF
To the bitter North-east wind.,JF
"Call the Maidens up, and find",JF
"Who lay longest, that she may",JF
Goe without a friend all day;,JF
"Then reward your Dogs, and pray",JF
_Pan_ to keep you from decay:,JF
So unfold and then away.,JF
What not a Shepherd stirring? sure the grooms,JF
"Have found their beds too easie, or the rooms",JF
"Fill'd with such new delight, and heat, that they",JF
"Have both forgot their hungry sheep, and day;",JF
"Knock, that they may remember what a shame",JF
Sloath and neglect layes on a Shepherds name.,JF
"_Old Shep_. It is to little purpose, not a swain",JF
"This night hath known his lodging here, or lain",JF
"Within these cotes: the woods, or some near town,",JF
"That is a neighbour to the bordering Down,",JF
"Hath drawn them thither, 'bout some lustie sport,",JF
"Or spiced Wassel-Boul, to which resort",JF
"All the young men and maids of many a cote,",JF
Whilst the trim Minstrel strikes his merry note.,JF
"_Priest_. God pardon sin, show me the way that leads",JF
To any of their haunts.,JF
"_Old Shep_. This to the meads,",JF
And that down to the woods.,JF
_Priest_. Then this for me;,JF
Come Shepherd let me crave your companie.    [_Exeunt_.,JF
"_Enter_ Clorin, _in her Cabin_, Alexis, _with her_.",JF
"_Clor_. Now your thoughts are almost pure,",JF
And your wound begins to cure:,JF
"Strive to banish all that's vain,",JF
Lest it should break out again.,JF
"_Alex_. Eternal thanks to thee, thou holy maid:",JF
I find my former wandring thoughts well staid,JF
"Through thy wise precepts, and my outward pain",JF
By thy choice herbs is almost gone again:,JF
Thy sexes vice and vertue are reveal'd,JF
"At once, for what one hurt, another heal'd.",JF
"_Clor_. May thy grief more appease,",JF
Relapses are the worst disease.,JF
"Take heed how you in thought offend,",JF
So mind and body both will mend.,JF
"_Enter_ Satyr, _with_ Amoret.",JF
"_Amo_. Beest thou the wildest creature of the wood,",JF
"That bearst me thus away, drown'd in my blood,",JF
"And dying, know I cannot injur'd be,",JF
"I am a maid, let that name fight for me.",JF
_Satyr_. Fairest Virgin do not fear,JF
"Me, that do thy body bear,",JF
"Not to hurt, but heal'd to be;",JF
Men are ruder far than we.,JF
"See fair _Goddess_ in the wood,",JF
They have let out yet more blood.,JF
Some savage man hath struck her breast,JF
"So soft and white, that no wild beast",JF
"Durst ha' toucht asleep, or wake:",JF
"So sweet, that _Adder, Newte_, or _Snake_,",JF
"Would have lain from arm to arm,",JF
On her bosom to be warm,JF
"All a night, and being hot,",JF
Gone away and stung her not.,JF
Quickly clap herbs to her breast;,JF
A man sure is a kind of beast.,JF
"_Clor_. With spotless hand, on spotless brest",JF
I put these herbs to give thee rest:,JF
"Which till it heal thee, will abide,",JF
"If both be pure, if not, off slide.",JF
"See it falls off from the wound,",JF
"Shepherdess thou art not sound,",JF
Full of lust.,JF
"_Satyr_, Who would have thought it,",JF
So fair a face?,JF
_Clor_. Why that hath brought it.,JF
"_Amo_. For ought I know or think, these words, my last:",JF
Yet _Pan_ so help me as my thoughts are chast.,JF
"_Clor_. And so may _Pan_ bless this my cure,",JF
As all my thoughts are just and pure;,JF
"Some uncleanness nigh doth lurk,",JF
That will not let my Medicines work.,JF
_Satyr_ search if thou canst find it.,JF
"_Satyr_. Here away methinks I wind it,",JF
"Stronger yet: Oh here they be,",JF
"Here, here, in a hollow tree,",JF
Two fond mortals have I found.,JF
"_Clor_. Bring them out, they are unsound.",JF
"_Enter_ Cloe, _and_ Daphnis.",JF
"_Satyr_. By the fingers thus I wring ye,",JF
To my _Goddess_ thus I bring ye;,JF
"Strife is vain, come gently in,",JF

"_Clor_. Hold _Satyr_, take this Glass,",JF
"Sprinkle over all the place,",JF
"Purge the Air from lustfull breath,",JF
"To save this Shepherdess from death,",JF
And stand you still whilst I do dress,JF
Her wound for fear the pain encrease.,JF
_Sat_. From this glass I throw a drop,JF
Of Crystal water on the top,JF
"Of every grass, on flowers a pair:",JF
Send a fume and keep the air,JF
"Pure and wholsom, sweet and blest,",JF
Till this Virgins wound be drest.,JF
"_Clor. Satyr_, help to bring her in.",JF
"_Sat_. By _Pan_, I think she hath no sin,",JF
She is so light: lye on these leaves.,JF
"Sleep that mortal sense deceives,",JF
"Crown thine Eyes, and ease thy pain,",JF
Maist thou soon be well again.,JF
"_Clor. Satyr_, bring the Shepherd near,",JF
Try him if his mind be clear.,JF
_Sat_. Shepherd come.,JF
_Daph_. My thoughts are pure.,JF
_Sat_. The better trial to endure.,JF
"_Clor_. In this flame his finger thrust,",JF
Which will burn him if he lust;,JF
"But if not, away will turn,",JF
As loth unspotted flesh to burn:,JF
"See, it gives back, let him go,",JF
"Farewel mortal, keep thee so.",JF
"_Sat_. Stay fair _Nymph_, flye not so fast,",JF
We must try if you be chaste:,JF
"Here's a hand that quakes for fear,",JF
Sure she will not prove so clear.,JF
"_Clor._ Hold her finger to the flame,",JF
That will yield her praise or shame.,JF
"_Sat._ To her doom she dares not stand,",JF
"But plucks away her tender hand,",JF
And the Taper darting sends,JF
His hot beams at her fingers ends:,JF
"O thou art foul within, and hast",JF
"A mind, if nothing else, unchaste.",JF
"_Alex._ Is not that _Cloe?_ 'tis my Love, 'tis she!",JF
"_Cloe_, fair _Cloe_.",JF
_Clo._ My Alexis.,JF
_Alex._ He.,JF
_Clo._ Let me embrace thee.,JF
"_Clor._ Take her hence,",JF
Lest her sight disturb his sence.,JF
"_Alex._ Take not her, take my life first.",JF
"_Clor._ See, his wound again is burst:",JF
"Keep her near, here in the Wood,",JF
Till I ha' stopt these Streams of Blood.,JF
"Soon again he ease shall find,",JF
If I can but still his mind:,JF
"This Curtain thus I do display,",JF
To keep the piercing air away.,JF
"_Enter_ old Shepherd, _and_ Priest.",JF
_Priest_. Sure they are lost for ever; 'tis in vain,JF
"To find 'em out with trouble and much pain,",JF
"That have a ripe desire, and forward will",JF
"To flye the Company of all but ill,",JF
What shall be counsel'd now? shall we retire?,JF
Or constant follow still that first desire,JF
We had to find them?,JF
_Old_. Stay a little while;,JF
For if the Morning mist do not beguile,JF
"My sight with shadows, sure I see a Swain;",JF
One of this jolly Troop's come back again.,JF
_Enter_ Thenot.,JF
"_Pri._ Dost thou not blush young Shepherd to be known,",JF
"Thus without care, leaving thy flocks alone,",JF
And following what desire and present blood,JF
"Shapes out before thy burning sense, for good,",JF
Having forgot what tongue hereafter may,JF
"Tell to the World thy falling off, and say",JF
"Thou art regardless both of good and shame,",JF
"Spurning at Vertue, and a vertuous Name,",JF
"And like a glorious, desperate man that buys",JF
"A poyson of much price, by which he dies,",JF
"Dost thou lay out for Lust, whose only gain",JF
"Is foul disease, with present age and pain,",JF
And then a Grave? These be the fruits that grow,JF
In such hot Veins that only beat to know,JF
"Where they may take most ease, and grow ambitious",JF
"Through their own wanton fire, and pride delicious.",JF
"_The_. Right holy Sir, I have not known this night,",JF
"What the smooth face of Mirth was, or the sight",JF
"Of any looseness; musick, joy, and ease,",JF
Have been to me as bitter drugs to please,JF
"A Stomach lost with weakness, not a game",JF
"That I am skill'd at throughly; nor a Dame,",JF
"Went her tongue smoother than the feet of Time,",JF
Her beauty ever living like the Rime,JF
"Our blessed _Tityrus_ did sing of yore,",JF
"No, were she more enticing than the store",JF
"Of fruitful Summer, when the loaden Tree",JF
"Bids the faint Traveller be bold and free,",JF
"Twere but to me like thunder 'gainst the bay,",JF
Whose lightning may enclose but never stay,JF
Upon his charmed branches; such am I,JF
Against the catching flames of Womans eye.,JF
_Priest_. Then wherefore hast thou wandred?,JF
_The_. 'Twas a Vow,JF
"That drew me out last night, which I have now",JF
"Strictly perform'd, and homewards go to give",JF
"Fresh pasture to my Sheep, that they may live.",JF
"_Pri_. 'Tis good to hear ye, Shepherd, if the heart",JF
In this well sounding Musick bear his part.,JF
Where have you left the rest?,JF
"_The_. I have not seen,",JF
Since yesternight we met upon this green,JF
"To fold our Flocks up, any of that train;",JF
"Yet have I walkt these Woods round, and have lain",JF
"All this same night under an aged Tree,",JF
"Yet neither wandring Shepherd did I see,",JF
"Or Shepherdess, or drew into mine ear",JF
"The sound of living thing, unless it were",JF
The Nightingale among the thick leav'd spring,JF
"That sits alone in sorrow, and doth sing",JF
"Whole nights away in mourning, or the Owl,",JF
Or our great enemy that still doth howl,JF
Against the Moons cold beams.,JF
_Priest_. Go and beware,JF
Of after falling.,JF
_The_. Father 'tis my care.       [_Exit_ Thenot.,JF
_Enter_ Daphnis.,JF
"_Old_. Here comes another Stragler, sure I see",JF
A Shame in this young Shepherd. _Daphnis_!,JF
_Daph_. He.,JF
"_Pri_. Where hast thou left the rest, that should have been",JF
"Long before this, grazing upon the green",JF
Their yet imprison'd flocks?,JF
"_Daph_. Thou holy man,",JF
Give me a little breathing till I can,JF
Be able to unfold what I have seen;,JF
Such horrour that the like hath never been,JF
Known to the ear of Shepherd: Oh my heart,JF
Labours a double motion to impart,JF
So heavy tidings! You all know the Bower,JF
"Where the chast _Clorin_ lives, by whose great power",JF
"Sick men and Cattel have been often cur'd,",JF
There lovely _Amoret_ that was assur'd,JF
"To lusty _Perigot_, bleeds out her life,",JF
Forc'd by some Iron hand and fatal knife;,JF
And by her young _Alexis_.,JF
_Enter_ Amaryllis _running from her_ Sullen Shepherd.,JF
_Amar_. If there be,JF
"Ever a Neighbour Brook, or hollow tree,",JF
"Receive my Body, close me up from lust",JF
"That follows at my heels;  be ever just,",JF
"Thou god of Shepherds, _Pan_, for her dear sake",JF
"That loves the Rivers brinks, and still doth shake",JF
In cold remembrance of thy quick pursuit:,JF
"Let me be made a reed, and ever mute,",JF
"Nod to the waters fall, whilst every blast",JF
Sings through my slender leaves that I was chast.,JF
"_Pri_. This is a night of wonder, _Amaryll_",JF
"Be comforted, the holy gods are still",JF
Revengers of these wrongs.,JF
"_Amar_. Thou blessed man,",JF
"Honour'd upon these plains, and lov'd of _Pan_,",JF
"Hear me, and save from endless infamie",JF
"My yet unblasted Flower, _Virginitie_:",JF
"By all the Garlands that have crown'd that head,",JF
"By the chaste office, and the Marriage bed",JF
"That still is blest by thee, by all the rights",JF
Due to our gods; and by those Virgin lights,JF
"That burn before his Altar, let me not",JF
Fall from my former state to gain the blot,JF
That never shall be purg'd: I am not now,JF
That wanton _Amaryllis_: here I vow,JF
"To Heaven, and thee grave Father, if I may",JF
"Scape this unhappy Night, to know the Day,",JF
"To live a Virgin, never to endure",JF
"The tongues, or Company of men impure.",JF
"I hear him come, save me.",JF
_Pri_. Retire a while,JF
"Behind this Bush, till we have known that vile",JF
Abuser of young Maidens.,JF
_Enter_ Sullen.,JF
"_Sul_. Stay thy pace,",JF
"Most loved _Amaryllis_, let the Chase",JF
"Grow calm and milder, flye me not so fast,",JF
I fear the pointed Brambles have unlac'd,JF
Thy golden Buskins; turn again and see,JF
"Thy Shepherd follow, that is strong and free,",JF
Able to give thee all content and ease.,JF
"I am not bashful, Virgin, I can please",JF
"At first encounter, hug thee in mine arm,",JF
"And give thee many Kisses, soft and warm",JF
As those the Sun prints on the smiling Cheek,JF
"Of Plums, or mellow Peaches; I am sleek",JF
"And smooth as _Neptune_, when stern _Eolus_",JF
"Locks up his surly Winds, and nimbly thus",JF
Can shew my active Youth; why dost thou flye?,JF
"Remember _Amaryllis_, it was I",JF
"That kill'd _Alexis_ for thy sake, and set",JF
An everlasting hate 'twixt _Amoret_,JF
And her beloved _Perigot_: 'twas I,JF
"That drown'd her in the Well, where she must lye",JF
"Till Time shall leave to be; then turn again,",JF
"Turn with thy open arms, and clip the Swain",JF
"That hath perform'd all this, turn, turn I say:",JF
I must not be deluded.,JF
"_Pri_. Monster stay,",JF
Thou that art like a Canker to the State,JF
"Thou liv'st and breath'st in, eating with debate",JF
"Through every honest bosome, forcing still",JF
"The Veins of any that may serve thy Will,",JF
Thou that hast offer'd with a sinful hand,JF
To seize upon this Virgin that doth stand,JF
Yet trembling here.,JF
"_Sull_. Good holiness declare,",JF
"What had the danger been, if being bare",JF
"I had embrac'd her, tell me by your Art,",JF
What coming wonders would that sight impart?,JF
"_Pri_. Lust, and a branded Soul.",JF
"_Sull_. Yet tell me more,",JF
Hath not our Mother Nature for her store,JF
"And great encrease, said it is good and just,",JF
And wills that every living Creature must,JF
Beget his like?,JF
"_Pri_. Ye are better read than I,",JF
"I must confess, in blood and Lechery.",JF
"Now to the Bower, and bring this Beast along,",JF
Where he may suffer Penance for his wrong.   [_Exeunt_.,JF
_Enter_ Perigot _with his hands bloody_.,JF
"_Per_. Here will I wash it in this mornings dew,",JF
Which she on every little grass doth strew,JF
In silver drops against the Sun's appear:,JF
"Tis holy water, and will make me clear.",JF
"My hands will not be cleans'd. My wronged Love,",JF
"If thy chaste spirit in the air yet move,",JF
Look mildly down on him that yet doth stand,JF
"All full of guilt, thy blood upon his hand,",JF
"And though I struck thee undeservedly,",JF
Let my revenge on her that injur'd thee,JF
"Make less a fault which I intended not,",JF
And let these dew drops wash away my spot.,JF
It will not cleanse. O to what sacred Flood,JF
Shall I resort to wash away this blood?,JF
Amid'st these Trees the holy _Clorin_ dwells,JF
"In a low Cabin of cut Boughs, and heals",JF
"All Wounds; to her I will my self address,",JF
And my rash faults repentantly confess;,JF
"Perhaps she'll find a means by Art or Prayer,",JF
"To make my hand with chaste blood stained, fair:",JF
"That done, not far hence underneath some Tree,",JF
"I'll have a little Cabin built, since she",JF
"Whom I ador'd is dead, there will I give",JF
"My self to strictness, and like _Clorin_ live.   [_Exit_.",JF
"_The Curtain is drawn_, Clorin _appears sitting in the Cabin,_ Amoret",JF
"_sitting on the one side of her_, Alexis _and_ Cloe _on the other, the_",JF
Satyr _standing by._,JF
"_Clo_. Shepherd, once more your blood is staid,",JF
"Take example by this Maid,",JF
"Who is heal'd ere you be pure,",JF
So hard it is lewd lust to cure.,JF
Take heed then how you turn your eye,JF
On each other lustfully:,JF
And Shepherdess take heed lest you,JF
Move his willing eye thereto;,JF
"Let no wring, nor pinch, nor smile",JF
Of yours his weaker sense beguile.,JF
"Is your Love yet true and chaste,",JF
And for ever so to last?,JF
"_Alex_. I have forgot all vain desires,",JF
"All looser thoughts, ill tempred fires,",JF
"True Love I find a pleasant fume,",JF
Whose moderate heat can ne'r consume.,JF
"_Clo_. And I a new fire feel in me,",JF
Whose chaste flame is not quencht to be.,JF
"_Clor_. Join your hands with modest touch,",JF
And for ever keep you such.,JF
_Enter_ Perigot.,JF
"_Per_. Yon is her Cabin, thus far off I'll stand,",JF
And call her forth; for my unhallowed hand,JF
I dare not bring so near yon sacred place.,JF
"_Clorin_ come forth, and do a timely grace",JF
To a poor Swain.,JF
_Clo_. What art thou that dost call?,JF
_Clorin_ is ready to do good to all:,JF
Come near.,JF
_Peri_. I dare not.,JF
"_Clor. Satyr_, see",JF
Who it is that calls on me.,JF
"_Sat_. There at hand, some Swain doth stand,",JF
Stretching out a bloudy hand.,JF
"_Peri_. Come _Clorin_, bring thy holy waters clear,",JF
To wash my hand.,JF
_Clo_. What wonders have been here,JF
"To night? stretch forth thy hand young Swain,",JF
Wash and rub it whilest I rain,JF
Holy water.,JF
"_Peri_. Still you pour,",JF
But my hand will never scower.,JF
"_Clor. Satyr_, bring him to the Bower,",JF
We will try the Soveraign power,JF
Of other waters.,JF
"_Satyr_. Mortal, sure",JF
Tis the Blood of Maiden pure,JF
That stains thee so.,JF
"[_The_ Satyr _leadeth him to the Bower, where he spieth_ Amoret, _and",JF
"kneeling down, she knoweth him_.",JF
"_Peri_. What e're thou be,",JF
"Be'st thou her spright, or some divinitie,",JF
"That in her shape thinks good to walk this grove,",JF
Pardon poor _Perigot_.,JF
"_Amor_. I am thy love,",JF
"Thy _Amoret_, for evermore thy love:",JF
"Strike once more on my naked breast, I'le prove",JF
As constant still. O couldst thou love me yet;,JF
How soon should I my former griefs forget!,JF
"_Peri_. So over-great with joy, that you live, now",JF
"I am, that no desire of knowing how",JF
Doth seize me; hast thou still power to forgive?,JF
"_Amo_. Whilest thou hast power to love, or I to live;",JF
More welcome now than hadst thou never gone,JF
Astray from me.,JF
_Peri_. And when thou lov'st alone,JF
"And not I, death, or some lingring pain",JF
"That's worse, light on me.",JF
_Clor_. Now your stain,JF
This perhaps will cleanse again;,JF
"See the blood that erst did stay,",JF
With the water drops away.,JF
"All the powers again are pleas'd,",JF
And with this new knot appeas'd.,JF
"Joyn your hands, and rise together,",JF
_Pan_ be blest that brought you hither.,JF
"_Enter_ Priest, _and_ Old Shephe[rd].",JF
"_Clor_. Go back again what ere thou art, unless",JF
"Smooth Maiden thoughts possess thee, do not press",JF
"This hallowed ground. Go _Satyr_, take his hand,",JF
And give him present trial.,JF
"_Satyr_. Mortal stand,",JF
Till by fire I have made known,JF
"Whether thou be such a one,",JF
That mayst freely tread this place.,JF
Hold thy hand up; never was,JF
More untainted flesh than this.,JF
"Fairest, he is full of bliss.",JF
"_Clor_. Then boldly speak, why dost thou seek this place?",JF
"_Priest_. First, honour'd Virgin, to behold thy face",JF
Where all good dwells that is: Next for to try,JF
The truth of late report was given to me:,JF
"Those Shepherds that have met with foul mischance,",JF
"Through much neglect, and more ill governance,",JF
Whether the wounds they have may yet endure,JF
"The open Air, or stay a longer cure.",JF
"And lastly, what the doom may be shall light",JF
"Upon those guilty wretches, through whose spight",JF
"All this confusion fell: For to this place,",JF
"Thou holy Maiden, have I brought the race",JF
"Of these offenders, who have freely told,",JF
"Both why, and by what means they gave this bold",JF
Attempt upon their lives.,JF
"_Clor_. Fume all the ground,",JF
"And sprinkle holy water, for unsound",JF
And foul infection 'gins to fill the Air:,JF
It gathers yet more strongly; take a pair,JF
"Of Censors fill'd with Frankincense and Mirrh,",JF
Together with cold Camphyre: quickly stir,JF
"Thee, gentle _Satyr_, for the place begins",JF
To sweat and labour with the abhorred sins,JF
"Of those offenders; let them not come nigh,",JF
For full of itching flame and leprosie,JF
"Their very souls are, that the ground goes back,",JF
And shrinks to feel the sullen weight of black,JF
And so unheard of venome; hie thee fast,JF
"Thou holy man, and banish from the chast",JF
"These manlike monsters, let them never more",JF
"Be known upon these downs, but long before",JF
"The next Suns rising, put them from the sight",JF
And memory of every honest wight.,JF
"Be quick in expedition, lest the sores",JF
Of these weak Patients break into new gores.     [_Ex_. Priest.,JF
"_Per_. My dear, dear _Amoret_, how happy are",JF
"Those blessed pairs, in whom a little jar",JF
"Hath bred an everlasting love, too strong",JF
"For time, or steel, or envy to do wrong?",JF
"How do you feel your hurts? Alas poor heart,",JF
How much I was abus'd; give me the smart,JF
For it is justly mine.,JF
_Amo_. I do believe.,JF
"It is enough dear friend, leave off to grieve,",JF
